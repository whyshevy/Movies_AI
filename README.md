# Movies Neural Network Chatbot App

The main goal of the startup is to create a smart cross-platform mobile application for iOS and Android in the form of a wise chatbot that could respond to requests from the end user.

The peculiarity of this bot format is that the user will receive a response in the format of combinations of famous phrases from cinematography and series, since the neural network model was trained on datasets of replicas and subtitles from many series and films.

At this stage, you can see just an attempt to create a seq2seq neural network model on python 3.10 using the scipy, tensorflow, numpy, keras libraries.
